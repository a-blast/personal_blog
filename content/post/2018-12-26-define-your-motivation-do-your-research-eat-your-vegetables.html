<h1>So you want to build a data product.</h1>
<p>Before you even try to touch your favorite text editor (hopefully <a href="http://spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs ðŸ‘½</a>), youâ€™ve got some work to do. Back when I worked in a biochemistry lab, and an experiment failed, my PI would always point out that often times spending a day in the library can save weeks in the lab (and a fat stack of money). This axiom sits true in any field where there is something worth doing.</p>
<p>So lets hit the library. But before you start surfing over their free WiFi, take a seat in front of the whiteboard. Itâ€™s good to have a coherent trail of thoughts as you venture into building anything sizable. My rule of thumb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If itâ€™s going to take longer than half a day, hit the notebook to plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step 1 in any plan of mine, state the objective, and <strong>WHY</strong> you want to get there. Maybe youâ€™re just picking up a Asana task your manager handed you, but it can become the most significant tool in a programmers belt to understand the intent behind the task. If your not excited enough by the idea that your hacking will physically move the needle of the organization youâ€™re working for, at least take solace in the fact that any domain knowledge you pick up might reveal the hints for an even more accurate, efficient, &amp; downright elegant solution.</p>

<h1>Defining your motivation (the why)</h1>
<p>When I say define your motivation, I donâ€™t mean write down how motivated you are to build this product on a scale of 1-10. You can save that for after work, while youâ€™re pondering the future of your career. I mean why is this a significant problem, why is this a difficult problem, perhaps why has this problem yet to be solved, or why solving this problem will move the needle for the company (or yourself).</p>
<div id="audit-the-pain" class="section level2">
<h2>Audit the pain</h2>
<p>At a previous job I was tasked to dive into warehouse data inconsistencies. So I watched warehouse training videos, took a virtual tour of the warehouse in question, and talked to many people who have been to the location or work there in person &amp; over e-mail. From here I was able to map out many possible avenues and make automated models to check several aspects of warehouse performance.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you need to put on your detective hat &amp; get your hands dirty to learn what needs to be built in the first place.</p>
