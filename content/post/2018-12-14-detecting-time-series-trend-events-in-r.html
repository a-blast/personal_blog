<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> To become maximally effective, all data scientists should know the flow of producing &amp; maintaining a data product to better understand how to fit their piece into the puzzle.</p>

<p><strong>The most important skill of any aspiring data professional is the ability to make kick butt, automated data features (and ultimately, products).</strong></p>
<p>This fact has given rise to what I‚Äôll dub here as the ‚Äúfull stack‚Äù data scientist. A full stack data scientist is someone comfortable with building the entire data product ‚Äúcircuit‚Äù him/herself. At a high level, this entails a command of comfort in building data pipelines, synthesizing readable code-bases, employing relevant statistical/machine learning paradigms, and interacting with an appropriate database that can empower the delivery of value that you ultimately want to produce. (Perhaps even a touch of front end web development if it fits your problem space üòÄ)</p>
<p>The truth is, in most positions, you wont have the capacity or expectations to build the entire data product yourself. Large teams of capable statisticians, developers, &amp; engineers make this possible. However while one may eventually become a specialist in a subset of data science over his/her career, very (<strong>VERY</strong>) few will ever have to conduct all of their work in complete isolation. Nearly every data scientist will work in a team that must co-ordinate their work into complete value-adding services. Thus everyone with hands in a data project should be familiar enough with the core processes to be able to answer general questions like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why does this need to be built in the first place?</strong><br />
</li>
<li>Who are the <em>stakeholders</em> in this service/product/feature?</li>
<li>How am I getting this <em>data</em> in (&amp; where does it come from)?<br />
</li>
<li>What other <em>services &amp; messaging queues</em> will I need to interact with?<br />
</li>
<li>What <em>language</em> is the best to write part x in?<br />
</li>
<li>Which <em>algorithm</em> will you pick to tackle the problem?<br />
</li>
<li>What <em>data structures</em> play best with my problem?<br />
</li>
<li>What <em>database</em> will be best to persist data to?<br />
</li>
<li>How should I structure my <em>schema</em>?<br />
</li>
<li>How can I improve the quality of the output via <em>statistical insight</em> &amp;&amp;/|| <em>machine learning</em>?<br />
</li>
<li>How performant is my solution, and where might <em>bottlenecks</em> arise?<br />
</li>
<li>How is this going to be <em>deployed</em>, and how can it be most <em>effectively monitored</em>?<br />
</li>
<li>What <em>tests</em> do I need to build to make sure this will hold up against the test of time?<br />
</li>
<li>Is what I‚Äôve written <em>readable</em>?<br />
</li>
<li>Can others easily <em>use, understand, &amp; interact</em> with my code?<br />
</li>
<li>How does this solution <em>scale</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>The ability to speak intelligently about all of these prompts with your colleagues will not only make you a more effective developer, but will also inevitably lead to better &amp; more maintainable products/services. You gain the knowledge of how to best fit your piece of the puzzle in with those of the team that may have been built 20 years ago, 20+ years in the future, or any other point in between.</p>
<p>The goal of this series is to go over my approach &amp; methodology to tackling these tricky questions as I have come to understand them. These posts will be loosely tied around my own experiences, word collages (in paragraph form!) of info, tips, tricks, &amp; facts I‚Äôve picked up along my ride, and a case study of building a micro service-based data feature that we are using at <a href="https://growatomata.com">Atomata</a> today for work with time series data streams to optimize indoor environments for cannabis cultivation.</p>
<p>I hope the process can be informative at all steps, but feel free to skip around. I‚Äôll be writing to this series over the upcoming weeks/months as time permits, hitting all of the questions posted above.</p>
