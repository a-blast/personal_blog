<p><strong>The most important skill of any aspiring data professional is the abillity to make kick butt, automated data features (and ultimately, products).</strong></p>
<p>This fact has given rise to what I’ll dub here as the “full stack” data scientist. A full stack data scientist is someone comfortable with building the entire data product “circuit” him/herself. At a high level, this entails a command of comfort in building data pipelines, synthesizing readable code-bases, employing relevant statistical/machine learning paradigms, and interacting with an appropriate database that can empower the delivery of value that you ultimately want to produce.</p>
<p>In this 3 part series I will outline my approach &amp; methodology to building a micro service-based data feature that we are using at <a href="https://growatomata.com">Atomata</a> today, for work with time series data streams to optimize indoor environments for cannabis cultivation. I hope the process can be informative at all steps, but feel free to skip around. I’ll be writing to this mini-series over the upcoming weeks as time permits.</p>
