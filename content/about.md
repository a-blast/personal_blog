<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"> Nice to finally meet you, it's been too long.</p>

First, thank you for taking the time to read some of the things I've written.

Second, here are a few things about me.

- I'm a biochemist turned computer nerd from the great urban fold of Denver, CO. </br>
- I read, program, and lead all things tech, team, & product at [Atomata](https://www.growatomata.com). </br>
- I wrangle data in R, build web stacks in react/node.js, glue odds & ends together / play with visual data in Python(3), and persist myself to the appropriate (NoSQL) database (and this blog). </br>

I hope to see you around here more.
Feel free to reach me through the little icons on the bottom of the page.

Until next time,

ðŸ––
