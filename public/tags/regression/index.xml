      <description>The most important skill of any aspiring data professional is the abillity to make kick butt, automated data features (and ultimately, products).
This fact has given rise to what I’ll dub here as the “full stack” data scientist. A full stack data scientist is someone comfortable with building the entire data product “circuit” him/herself. At a high level, this entails a command of comfort in building data pipelines, synthesizing readable code-bases, employing relevant statistical/machine learning paradigms, and interacting with an appropriate database that can empower the delivery of value that you ultimately want to produce.</description>
