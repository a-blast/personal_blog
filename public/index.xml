      <description>So you want to build a data product. Before you even try to touch your favorite text editor (hopefully Spacemacs üëΩ), you‚Äôve got some work to do. Back when I worked in a biochemistry lab, and an experiment failed, my PI would always point out that often times spending a day in the library can save weeks in the lab (and a fat stack of money). This axiom sits true in any field where there is something worth doing.</description>

      <description>The most important skill of any aspiring data professional is the abillity to make kick butt, automated data features (and ultimately, products).
This fact has given rise to what I‚Äôll dub here as the ‚Äúfull stack‚Äù data scientist. A full stack data scientist is someone comfortable with building the entire data product ‚Äúcircuit‚Äù him/herself. At a high level, this entails a command of comfort in building data pipelines, synthesizing readable code-bases, employing relevant statistical/machine learning paradigms, and interacting with an appropriate database that can empower the delivery of value that you ultimately want to produce.</description>

      <description>Nice to finally meet you, it&#39;s been too long.
First, thank you for taking the time to read some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve written.
Second, here are a few things about me.
 I&amp;rsquo;m a biochemist turned computer nerd from the great urban fold of Denver, CO.  I read, program, and lead all things tech, team, &amp;amp; product at Atomata.  I wrangle data in R, build web stacks in react/node.</description>
